### Features

* Displays the most popular gifs from the Giphy API.
* Supports real-time searching and updating.
* Uses Bloc and Cubit for state management.

### Design Decisions

While developing the app, the following design decisions were made:

* Two-column layout for a better viewing experience.
* The height of each gif is determined by the height property in the API response.
* Use of loading spinners and error messages to provide a smooth user experience.

### Tech Stack

This Flutter project utilizes various packages and libraries to achieve its functionality. Here's a breakdown of the key dependencies:

- **Bloc and Flutter Bloc**: Bloc is at the heart of this application's state management. The Flutter Bloc package extends Bloc and is used to handle the app's state effectively. Cubit plays a significant role in managing the app's state, especially in scenarios like:

  - Loading the initial trending gifs.
  - Searching for gifs.
  - Handling state changes when the search completes.
  - Managing error states when no results are found.

Cubit provides a clear and structured way to manage the app's state, making it easy to handle asynchronous operations and UI updates, resulting in a smooth and responsive user experience.


- **HTTP**: The HTTP package is used to make API requests to the Giphy API, fetching data to display on the app's user interface.

- **Flutter Staggered Grid View**: This package is used to create the two-column layout in the app, providing a visually appealing way to display the gifs. It is especially useful for handling varying gif heights.

- **Cached Network Image**: Cached Network Image is used to efficiently load and cache images, ensuring smooth and fast loading of gifs in the app.

- **Flutter Dotenv**: The Flutter Dotenv package is used for managing environment variables. It securely loads API keys and other sensitive data from a .env file in the app's assets.

All of these packages are essential in building a performant, visually pleasing, and smoothly functioning app for displaying trending gifs from the Giphy API.
